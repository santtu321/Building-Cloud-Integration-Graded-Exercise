# Building-Cloud-Integration-Graded-Exercise
so heres my work which is somewhat working. For the teacher/peer rewievers I tried to implement some features, but i started to do this project way too late so as you can see its pretty bare-bones.
The register works atleast it returns created when im sending info using postman, but I also had alot of problems trying to implement the security to there so it is kinda implemented, but it doesnt work. Also I havent done any tests to my application.
Im hoping that this passes the course and i understand if it doesnt but just so you know I tried to implement somethings and there are some things that just need some work to make them work.


Have a good day!

kind regards
